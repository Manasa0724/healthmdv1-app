 **Note:** Before committing any changes, ensure that all API keys (OpenRouter, Gemini, Supabase) are loaded exclusively from `app.config.js â†’ extra` using values defined in `.env`. Verify that `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits. After changes, clear the local cache and run the app to confirm no hardcoded secrets remain in any code path.
